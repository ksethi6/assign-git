• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out.

• Why should you have different branches?
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

You can have as many remotes as you want, but you can only have one remote named "origin".
